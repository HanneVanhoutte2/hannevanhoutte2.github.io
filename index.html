  <h1>Welcome!</h1>
  
  <p>Hi, I'm <strong>Hanne Vanhoutte</strong>, an exchange student from Howest University of Applied Sciences in Belgium. I'm a third-year software engineering student graduating in August 2026.</p>

  <h2>About Me</h2>
  
  <p>Through my studies at Howest, I've gained experience with multiple programming languages including Flutter/Dart, Python, C#, JavaScript, and more. In my first year, I developed a foundational understanding of security concepts, including the basics of web penetration testing and security protocols.</p>
  
  <p>While I'm currently pursuing software engineering, I have a strong interest in cybersecurity and plan to pursue a cybersecurity major after completing my current degree. This semester, I'm diving deeper into applied cryptography and expanding my knowledge in security practices.</p>
