## About Me

Hi, I'm Hanne, a third-year software engineering student at Howest in Belgium. I'm passionate about UI/UX design, web development, and cybersecurity. Currently diving deep into applied cryptography, digital forensics, and building secure applications.

When I'm not coding, you'll find me baking, singing in choir, or creating illustrations.
